Your Netlify deploy failed because a required module, **`swiper/react`**, couldn't be found during the build. The error log explicitly states that the file `src/components/Carousel.js` is trying to import this module, but it's not available in the project's dependencies.

### The Problem

The build process on Netlify runs `npm install` to download all the packages listed in your `package.json` file. If a package isn't listed there, Netlify can't install it, and the build fails when it encounters an `import` statement for that missing package.

### The Solution

You need to add `swiper` as a dependency in your `package.json` file.

1.  **Add the dependency to `package.json`**:

      * Open your project's `package.json` file.
      * Add `"swiper": "version_number"` to the `"dependencies"` section. The latest stable version is a good choice.

2.  **Commit and push the changes**:

      * Save the `package.json` file.
      * Commit the change to your Git repository: `git commit -m "Add swiper dependency"`.
      * Push the updated code to your repository: `git push`.

Netlify will automatically detect the change in your `package.json` and start a new build. This time, it will download and install the `swiper` package, resolving the `Cannot find module` error and allowing your build to succeed.

### Updated `package.json`

Here is a corrected snippet of your `package.json` file with the `swiper` dependency added.

```json

  "version": "0.1.0",
  "private": true,
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.2.0",

    "swiper": "^11.0.3"  // Add this line
  },

  },
